# Answer for GZNU
This is a repo for GZNU's students who are study in School of International Education. 

## This repo include:
1. Java
2. Data Structure 1

## How to use it?
In `Solve.java`, it include all homework for Java1, Kai Xu teached. For every question, I encapsulate the solution as a function. If you wanna submit your homework, just change the `main` function as you want.

In the folder `DataStructure`, I give some example or complete implementation for one homework. You could based on my code to change your demands.
